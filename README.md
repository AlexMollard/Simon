# Simon

**To-Do:**
- Add timing mechanic to give the player a sense of urgancy.
- ~~Commenting and tidying up~~
- ~~Make esc key return to main menu~~

**Bugs/Glitches**
- ~~Rare bug when the player clicks a colour it adds to the highscore and player wont lose.~~
  ~~(Occured when player had clicked a colour after their turn but just before simons turn)~~
  ~~[Should be fixed if lose detection is fixed]~~
- ~~Lost detection only works first and last move.~~
- If you click a colour quickly after losing you add a extra point to your score.
- (This is due to the player clicking the correct square twice before the timer ends.)
