# Simon

**To-Do:**
- Record HighScore in text/binary file.
- Add leveling system.
- ~~Make esc key return to main menu~~

**Bugs/Glitches**
- Rare bug when the player clicks a colour it adds to the highscore and player wont lose.
  (Occured when player had clicked a colour after their turn but just before simons turn)
  [Should be fixed if lose detection is fixed]
- Lost detection only works first and last move.
